  "what_is_my_connection_to_javascript": "1: Since I was 11 years old, I wanted to create websites (or 'homepages' ;) ). Therefore it was just necassary to learn a bit JavaScript, at least jQuery. As I got older, my interest in computer science in general, and especially my passion for web development, grew. For about 2 years I've been working on projects with Backbone (first CoffeeScript, now ES6). For some side-projects I use Middleman with pure JavaScript, for some others node.",
