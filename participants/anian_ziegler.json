  "what_is_my_connection_to_javascript": "I am the lead developer at cioplenu and work across the full stack in javascript/typescript. Mostly in the backend these days. I really like working with tools like hapi, objection.js and typescript in node and exchanging ideas about that. Apart from that I'm a huge Linux fan and love building our infrastructure at cioplenu.",
  "what_can_i_contribute": "I can share experiences from building up a startup for two years now with a product which is a web application but not the ususal SAAS. We deploy in the cloud and to individual customers as well. Apart from that I'd love to share some experiences with stuff I use in my day to day business like objection.js or database migrations and UNIX tools.",
