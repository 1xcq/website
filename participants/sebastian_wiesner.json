I made terribly experiences with Angular 1.x in the past, and am now very happy to work on a sane and well-written Javascript frontend.  While I still prefer to write backend code in Scala, I've really come to like frontend developer, despite my Haskell background.  I still like to talk about programming language design, verification and type systems, though! Be warned! ;)",
  "what_can_i_contribute": "I can share our experiences with ES6, React and Redux, and tell you about our success, and the mistakes that we made in the design of our application and the choice of technologies.  On behalf of my employer I've also got jobs to offer which will let you build a great product with Typescript and React!",
